<h2>Differential Effects of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Delivery Formats in Depressive Patients dataset</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data set contains simulated effect sizes of randomized controlled trials evaluating the (relative) effectiveness of
cognitive behavioral therapy for depression, using different delivery formats.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This simulated data set is based on pooled results of a network
meta-analysis examining the effects of different cognitive behavioral therapy
(CBT) delivery formats in adults with depression (Cuijpers et al., 2019). Using
network meta-analysis techniques on this data set will yield roughly similar,
although not identical results to the ones reported in the original study.
</p>
<p>For the simulation, pooled effects within designs as reported in Cuijpers et al. along with the estimated
between-study heterogeneity variance were assumed as true population parameters.
Based on these &quot;true&quot; population parameters, simulations
were generated assuming a (random-effects) bayesian hierarchical model, using a
non-central chi-squared distribution for the simulation of study-specific sampling errors.
The number of effect size draws was chosen to (approximately)
mimic the number of comparisons in the original analysis.
</p>
<p>This is an alternative version of the data set, adapted for out-of-the-box usage in <code>gemtc</code>.
