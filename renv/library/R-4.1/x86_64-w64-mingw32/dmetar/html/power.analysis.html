<h2>A priori power calculator</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function performs an <em>a priori</em> power estimation of a meta-analysis
for different levels of assumed between-study heterogeneity.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
power.analysis(d, OR, k, n1, n2, p = 0.05, heterogeneity = 'fixed')
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>d</code></td>
<td>
<p>The hypothesized, or plausible overall effect size of a treatment/intervention under study compared
to control, expressed as the standardized mean difference (<em>SMD</em>). Effect sizes must be positive
numerics (i.e., expressed as positive effect sizes).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>OR</code></td>
<td>
<p>The hypothesized, or plausible overall effect size of a treatment/intervention under study compared
to control, expressed as the Odds Ratio (<em>OR</em>). If both <code>d</code> and <code>OR</code> are specified, results
will only be computed for the value of <code>d</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>k</code></td>
<td>
<p>The expected number of studies to be included in the meta-analysis.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>n1</code></td>
<td>
<p>The expected, or plausible mean sample size of the treatment group in the studies to be included in the meta-analysis.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>n2</code></td>
<td>
<p>The expected, or plausible mean sample size of the control group in the studies to be included in the meta-analysis.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>p</code></td>
<td>
<p>The alpha level to be used for the power computation. Default is <i>&alpha; = 0.05</i>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>heterogeneity</code></td>
<td>
<p>Which level of between-study heterogeneity to assume for the meta-analysis. Can be either
<code>"fixed"</code> for no heterogeneity/a fixed-effect model, <code>"low"</code> for low heterogeneity, <code>"moderate"</code>
for moderate-sized heterogeneity or <code>"high"</code> for high levels of heterogeneity. Default is <code>"fixed"</code>.</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>While researchers conducting primary studies can plan the size of their sample
based on the effect size they want to find, the situation is a different in
meta-analysis, where one can only work with the published material.
However, researchers have some control over the number of studies they want to include in their
meta-analysis (e.g., through more leniently or strictly defined inclusion criteria).
Therefore, one can change the power to some extent by including more or less studies into
the meta-analysis. Conventionally, a power of <i>1-&beta; = 0.8</i> is deemed sufficient to detect an existing effect.
There are four things one has to make assumptions about when assessing the power of a meta-analysis a priori.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> The number of included or includable studies
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The overall size of the studies we want to include (are the studies in the field rather small or large?)
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The effect size. This is particularly important, as assumptions have to be made
about how big an effect size has to be to still be clinically meaningful. One study calculated
that for interventions for depression, even effects as small as <em>SMD</em>=0.24 may still
be meaningful for patients (Cuijpers et al. 2014). If the aim is to study negative effects of an
intervention (e.g., death or symptom deterioration), even very small effect sizes are extremely
important and should be detected.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The heterogeneity of our studies’ effect sizes, as this also affects the precision of the pooled estimate,
and thus its potential to find significant effects.
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>The <code>power.analysis</code> function implements the formula by Borenstein et al. (2011) to calculate
the power estimate. Odds Ratios are converted to <code>d</code> internally before the power is estimated, and
are then reconverted.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a <code>list</code> with two elements:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>Plot</code>: A plot showing the effect size (x), power (y), estimated power (red point) and
estimated power for changing effect sizes (blue line). A dashed line at 80% power is also provided as a visual threshold for sufficient power.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>Power</code>: The <strong>estimated power</strong> of the meta-analysis, expressed as a value between 0 and 1 (i.e., 0%-100%).
</p>
</li></ul>
