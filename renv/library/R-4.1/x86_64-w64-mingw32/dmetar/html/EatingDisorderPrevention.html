<h2>Prevention of Eating Disorders at Universities dataset</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is a dataset containing effect size data of a meta-analysis synthesizing
randomized controlled trials comparing the preventive effect of psychobehavioral interventions
delivered at universities on incidence rates of subthreshold and full-symptom eating disorders.
Effect size data is provided as the number of cases and the person time at risk calculated for
the intervention and control group.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This data set was used in a meta-analysis examining the effect of preventive eating disorder interventions
at universities (Harrer et al., 2020). The data refers to the analysis in which the treatment arms of trials
with more than one intervention group were combined so that each study is the meta-analysis is statistically independent;
resulting in slightly different results then the ones reported in the abstract of the article. Person time at risk values
were rounded and therefore differ slightly from the ones reported in the study.
